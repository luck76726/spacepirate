You meet someone for the first time only to never meet them again. You like them, love spending time with them but such is the tragedy of life that they become a faded memory. They die off, you don't feel them around anymore but they change you in some way. Something inside you will never stay the same again. You will long for them, miss them, remember them sometimes. But that time, that moment will be gone. That's the puzzle of life. In this vast universe, that moment, that feeling, how small it was yet it encompasses all of time and all of space. The whole universe captures itself in that moment, in that little piece of Nostalgia.
