## Feels like a burden to write my first piece of write up (blog or whatever this is)

I was very motivated to write 2 days ago but I didn't and now it’s become *meh...*  
Still, I think I should write it. Gotta start somewhere (this advice is a cliché and a very very sucky one and it never resonates with me but still).

---

## So what is this about?

*(this website and what I would do here, hopefully, if I get out of bed with enough motivation that is)*

I think it's a personal space for me to try and express thoughts and ideas (if I can actually articulate better than a 9-year-old) and sometimes random arbitrary s**tposting and just yapping about anything or everything.

If you're actually going to read it, I'd like to say (shout this until my lungs give up):

> Everything you will read here are and will be my personal opinions/thoughts.  
> Don't take any of it with any sincerity whatsoever (please don't commit the mistake of considering me as a sane, stable adult because I am not).

They will just be jokes (almost never funny ones!!) and I would be putting up some act with a mask on (I don't have a real personality).

## Some things that I like (a.k.a hobbies/interests)
    (Not an exhaustive list)

### Travel

I always thought about solo traveling and loved the concept but never did it until recently.  
Surprisingly, for now, I don't hate it and I haven't died of panic, scare or overwhelm. \
That's a plus I guess!

### Music

I think I should eventually start putting up the music I like here.  
I enjoy all kinds of songs, genres, music (in general). I don't have a preference or taste, it totally depends on my mood and sometimes the weather.

*P.S.* — I sincerely think that people who have a favorite genre in music are very successful career-driven people who just also happen to be soulless psychopaths.

### Books

I don't have the motivation right now to explain how or why I like books (that is on the precondition that my mind gets calm and stable enough to read 2 sentences before changing context or forgetting that it was reading in the first place — and many such delicacies it comes up with WHEN I AM TRYING TO READ A FREAKIN' BOOK).  
Maybe later!

Ohh btw, since we are at the subject of reading. A tip I recently discovered for better comprehension is to read out loud (preferably to someone else).  
This works with fiction books (that’s what I have tested this on, for now).

I recently read the first chapter of White Nights by Dostoyevsky, to a girl with a beautiful voice and a laugh good enough to put me to sleep forever, when I discovered this tip.  
Yeah you can be jealous if you're a guy reading this.  
And why are you even reading this as a guy (are you gay? don't be gay please. Not in 2026, GAWD!!).

### Food

YES I AM FOODIE (I should be publicly executed for saying this, I am so so so sorry!).  
But I do like spaghetti ,red and mix sauce pasta, some good English tea, and moka coffee (black with sugar).  
I enjoy other cuisines as well; I just can't remember at the moment.
